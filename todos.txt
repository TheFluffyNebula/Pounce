frontend
scoreboard
* tally by round, append child (sum at the end)
styles for scoreboard, room creation screen

backend
2. store player state in App (move logic to backend)
* functions now call socket.emit instead, pass information over to backend
* consider server side validation for robustness
3. game flow
* round start, round end, game end

possible optimizations:
roomSockets.js: dropTableau, moving helpers outside
cache consistency/smoother experience (but could lead to race conditions): send frontend update first
