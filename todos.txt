frontend
* tally by round

backend
* consider server side validation for robustness
3. game flow
* round start, round end, game end

deployment
edit sockets, render commands

possible optimizations:
roomSockets.js: dropTableau, moving helpers outside
cache consistency/smoother experience (but could lead to race conditions): send frontend update first
